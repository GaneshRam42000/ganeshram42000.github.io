Hello guys this is my second post and I'm still getting along to get my thoughts in place and trying to sound professional and be informative at the same time.
If you find any issue in my content logically or gramatically (my skills are not that good ðŸ¥²); feel free to drop a mail or a pull request.

PS. I won't be changing anything unless there is a valid criticism.

Now to the main issue.Before coming to a conclusion we need to understand and equip with some knowledge of what is an homeserver?, what is it's usecase? and why we need to consider to have one?.This post can be a useful for somebody who plans to have their homeserver or someone who dosen't even know what this means. Let's get started now..

## What is a homeserver ?
A homeserver is can any computing device (your old pc , laptop, or an SBC like a raspberrypi) that is used to host some series of application in the convinence of your home and those are availaible only through your home network or can be exposed to the internet for your use and used by only people you allow. 

These applications are similar to any cloud based applications that you use on day to day basis from streaming servers like netflix to complex project management suites like jira. You can check some list of applications that you can host on your machine in this github [repository](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted).

## What is the usecase for a homeserver ?

Having your own homeserver have some benifits ;
- Some services that you need to pay to use in the cloud is availaible freely.
- There is also an added advantage of security in that you are not relying on any company to keep your data safe.
- You have control over what data you are exposing to the web and what data stays in your network.
- Moreover storage cost of these services reduces drastically once you set up everything, as you dont need to play any premium to any company to save your some more photos. 

The major usecase for homeservers are to server you with any service within your home network that you wish to have.

## Do you need one ?

Well it's a question that you need to think for yourself.these are some of my answers that I took when having my own homeserver.

#### Is it worth your time and money ?

Yes,the time I spent on creating your own homeserver was useful for me as I was able to understand lot of stuff about networking ,devops and many other software development techniques. Also the money I spent is nothing as I used my old pc. 

#### Is it hard to setup and maintain ?

This depends on person to person. Some would find it easy while others don't even want to change their password in wifi router. For many folks this should be a learning experience. Trail and error is the key.
