Hello guys this is my second post and I'm still getting along to get my thoughts in place and trying to sound professional and be informative at the same time.
If you find any issue in my content logically or gramatically (my skills are not that good ðŸ¥²); feel free to drop a mail or a pull request.

PS. I won't be changing anythig unless there is a valid criticism.

Now to the main issue.Before coming to a conclusion we need to understand and equip with some knowledge of what is an homeserver?, what is it's usecase? and why we need to consider to have one?.This post can be a useful for somebody who plans to have their homeserver or someone who dosen't even know what this means. Let's get started now..

## What is a homeserver ?
The home server is used to any PC that is used to host some series of application in the convinence of your home and those are availaible only through your home network or can be exposed to the internet for your use and used by only people you allow. 

These applications are similar to any cloud based applications that you use on day to day basis from streaming servers like netflix to complex projext management suites like jira. You can check some list of applications that you can host on your machine in this github [repository](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted).
