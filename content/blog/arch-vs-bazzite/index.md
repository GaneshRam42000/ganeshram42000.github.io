For more than 5 years I have been distro hopping .Through these years I have come to know lot about software and linux in general.Now it's time for me to settle down with either of these distros **Bazzite** or **Arch**. In this article I would be weighing down the pros and cons of each distributions and come to a conclusion on choosing which distribution that I picked at last.

## Why Arch ?

First of all [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) is a rolling release distro, which means that you would be getting software update for all the applications and latest kernel patches more frequentely.

What Arch offers is robust set of packages and the Arch User Repository(AUR) which makes it easy for any developer to package their applications directely from source.

Arch is also very hackable which in the sense means it can be modified easily and can be tailor made to your preferences from scratch.Users have the freedom to do whatever with their system modify each and every aspect of how their operating system needs to work. There is no hand holding here.

Also Arch is a widely used distro which means you would be getting a bit more help from the community if you ae stuck.The community is mostly friendly to even "stupid" questions, but thre are always a few who are not that friendly.

### Problems in using Arch

The main issue with Arch is it's steep learning cureve which is required to use arch. Even the install process could be an hazzle for a normal user who wanted to use Arch. Yes, there is an well documented and well maintained wiki pages and blogs to get going but it is very hard for an average user to know all the jargons just to watch some youtube videos or process some word documents.

Apart from this there is one more issue, that is the community. I'm not saying that all are toxic, but a few are bit hostile to new useres ,especially if you have some questions that are very obivious to them. It's better to stick with a distro which are user friendly to install and cater to new users who migrate from windows or mac os.

## Why Bazzite ?
{{< figure align="center" src="/images/blog/arch-vs-bazzite/Bazzite Tagline.svg" height="132" width="400" >}}

[Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg/) is an immutable linux distribution, which means that that the root folder is write protected and any change that is made will be on top of the base system. This means if there is any updates or changes that breaks the system it can be easily reverted back. 

Bazzite also comes with many apps and features that are specifically tailoured for gaming. Users don't need to worry about installing any new drivers for graphic card as they are automatically installed during the setup.

Bazzite is an distribution based on fedora silverblue which makes it easy to install all the rpm packaged apps and gives access to the rpm fusion repository.

They also supports many handhled consoles like Steam Deck, ROG Ally etc..

### problems in using Bazzite

Bazzite's main issue is being a immuatable distro and also being a gaming centerd os. Also this being an fedora based distribution; there are many good options for gaming like [nobara](https://nobaraproject.org/).

This can be a better for a gaming handheld hardware or a console .But for a normal desktop user who need packages to do some actual work this can be a hazzle. Also if you need a atomic desktop ypu can better choose the upstream fedora silverblue edition as I had an issue with updating bazzite due to a expired certificate issue.

## What I chose

This can be a nobrainer for someone; I chose Arch üëç.
