Hello, I'm Ganesh. {{< abt-img >}}

I'm a Computer Science engineer hailing from India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³. At the moment, I'm preparing to pursue a Master's degree. This site is where I'll share a variety of topics that interest me and document my thoughts. I'm passionate about video games, cricket, and other hobbies.

This blog serves as a space for me to discuss my discoveries and opinions on different subjects that I find worth sharing.

If anyone is reading this (though Iâ€™m not expecting many), feel free to reach out to me on social media or via email. Iâ€™m not the best at chatting in real time, so please forgive me if I come across as rude or harsh ðŸ¥².
